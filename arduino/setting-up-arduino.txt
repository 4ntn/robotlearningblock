# A Personal Guide to setting up the Arduino IDE

This guide explains how to setup the Arduino IDE on a development PC in order to program a new task board microcontroller

## Instructions for setting up on Linux Ubuntu
1. Download the zip file of the arduino ide from the arduino website
https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/linux
2. Unzip the file
3. Open the arduino IDE by running the arduino.sh file in a terminal
4. Add the Espressif URL to the board manager list in Preferences
    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
5. Add the board files for ESP32 using the Board Manager
6. Add the libraries for ESP32 and M5StickC
7. Install pyserial with pip3. (Optional)

## Verify setup
Plug in the M5StickC board and see if it is recognized by the computer. It should be viewable in the arduino IDE under Mene/Tools/Port as /dev/cu.usbserial.###### on MacOS or /dev/ttyUSB# on Linux.

Before uploading to the board, set the board target, port and baud rate in the IDE under the Menu/Tools.
- Board=M5StickC, 
- Port=/dev/ttyUSB0, 
- Baud=1500000

Note that each task board controller should have a unique Token in order to be recognized by Kaa. Tokens have the general form of "task-board-100". To generate a new token go to the [Kaa Device Management Portal](https://cloud.kaaiot.com/devices/device-management/), select the correct Application, this project is currently using "smart task board proto" with App Version Name="c1v9jqmgul2l1s47m6bg-v0" and generate a new token by clickgin on "Add device" in the top right of the window. Specify a new Token ID and then update the `secrets.h` file with the new token under SECRET_TOKEN.

The current subscription with Kaa is limited to 15 devices. 

## Flashing new firmware to the task board microcontroller
After verifying all the steps above you can flash the new firmware to the microcontroller with the "upload" command.

Wait for the upload to take place (~1min)...Then you should see the message upload complete in the IDE.
