# README Task Board Python Simulator

The task board has a python simulator that emulates MQTT packets sent from a physical task board. This is useful for debugging. Currently, there is a simulator environment configured with Replit.com.

View and run the simulator: [Task Board Simulator](https://replit.com/@peterso/TaskBoardSimulator#main.py)

A goal would be to create simulator that runs locally. However the Replit sim seems to be working fine and is currently working for free.
