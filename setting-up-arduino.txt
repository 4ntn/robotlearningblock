# A Personal Guide

1. Download the zip file of the arduino ide from the arduino website
https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/linux
2. Unzip the file
3. Open the arduino IDE by running the arduino.sh file in a terminal
4. Add the Espressif URL to the board manager list in Preferences
    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
5. Add the board files for ESP32 using the Board Manager
6. Add the libraries for ESP32 and M5StickC
7. Install pyserial with pip3.

# Verify setup
Plug in the M5StickC board and see if it is recognized by the computer. It should be viewable in the arduino ide. 

Before uploading to the board, set the board target, port and baud rate in the IDE. Board=M5StickC, Port=/dev/ttyUSB0, Baud=115200.

Open a sketch and attempt to compile and upload to the board. 
Wait for the upload to take place (~1min)...Then you should see the message upload complete in the IDE.
